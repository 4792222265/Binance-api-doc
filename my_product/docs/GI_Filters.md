# Filters
Filters define trading rules on a symbol or an exchange.
Filters come in two forms: `symbol filters` and `exchange filters`.

## Symbol Filters
### PRICE_FILTER
The `PRICE_FILTER` defines the `price` rules for a symbol. There are 3 parts:

* `minPrice` defines the minimum `price`/`stopPrice` allowed; disabled on `minPrice` == 0.
* `maxPrice` defines the maximum `price`/`stopPrice` allowed; disabled on `maxPrice` == 0.
* `tickSize` defines the intervals that a `price`/`stopPrice` can be increased/decreased by; disabled on `tickSize` == 0.

Any of the above variables can be set to 0, which disables that rule in the `price filter`. In order to pass the `price filter`, the following must be true for `price`/`stopPrice` of the enabled rules:

* `price` >= `minPrice` 
* `price` <= `maxPrice`
* (`price`-`minPrice`) % `tickSize` == 0

**/exchangeInfo format:**
```javascript
  {
    "filterType": "PRICE_FILTER",
    "minPrice": "0.00000100",
    "maxPrice": "100000.00000000",
    "tickSize": "0.00000100"
  }
```

### PERCENT_PRICE
The `PERCENT_PRICE` filter defines valid range for a price based on the average of the previous trades.
`avgPriceMins` is the number of minutes the average price is calculated over. 0 means the last price is used.

In order to pass the `percent price`, the following must be true for `price`:
* `price` <= `weightedAveragePrice` * `multiplierUp`
* `price` >= `weightedAveragePrice` * `multiplierDown`

**/exchangeInfo format:**
```javascript
  {
    "filterType": "PERCENT_PRICE",
    "multiplierUp": "1.3000",
    "multiplierDown": "0.7000",
    "avgPriceMins": 5
  }
```

### LOT_SIZE
The `LOT_SIZE` filter defines the `quantity` (aka "lots" in auction terms) rules for a symbol. There are 3 parts:

* `minQty` defines the minimum `quantity`/`icebergQty` allowed.
* `maxQty` defines the maximum `quantity`/`icebergQty` allowed.
* `stepSize` defines the intervals that a `quantity`/`icebergQty` can be increased/decreased by.

In order to pass the `lot size`, the following must be true for `quantity`/`icebergQty`:

* `quantity` >= `minQty`
* `quantity` <= `maxQty`
* (`quantity`-`minQty`) % `stepSize` == 0

**/exchangeInfo format:**
```javascript
  {
    "filterType": "LOT_SIZE",
    "minQty": "0.00100000",
    "maxQty": "100000.00000000",
    "stepSize": "0.00100000"
  }
```

### MIN_NOTIONAL
The `MIN_NOTIONAL` filter defines the minimum notional value allowed for an order on a symbol.
An order's notional value is the `price` * `quantity`.
`applyToMarket` determines whether or not the `MIN_NOTIONAL` filter will also be applied to `MARKET` orders.
Since `MARKET` orders have no price, the average price is used over the last `avgPriceMins` minutes.
`avgPriceMins` is the number of minutes the average price is calculated over. 0 means the last price is used.


**/exchangeInfo format:**
```javascript
  {
    "filterType": "MIN_NOTIONAL",
    "minNotional": "0.00100000",
    "applyToMarket": true,
    "avgPriceMins": 5
  }
```

### ICEBERG_PARTS
The `ICEBERG_PARTS` filter defines the maximum parts an iceberg order can have. The number of `ICEBERG_PARTS` is defined as `CEIL(qty / icebergQty)`.

**/exchangeInfo format:**
```javascript
  {
    "filterType": "ICEBERG_PARTS",
    "limit": 10
  }
```

### MARKET_LOT_SIZE
The `MARKET_LOT_SIZE` filter defines the `quantity` (aka "lots" in auction terms) rules for `MARKET` orders on a symbol. There are 3 parts:

* `minQty` defines the minimum `quantity` allowed.
* `maxQty` defines the maximum `quantity` allowed.
* `stepSize` defines the intervals that a `quantity` can be increased/decreased by.

In order to pass the `market lot size`, the following must be true for `quantity`:

* `quantity` >= `minQty`
* `quantity` <= `maxQty`
* (`quantity`-`minQty`) % `stepSize` == 0

**/exchangeInfo format:**
```javascript
  {
    "filterType": "MARKET_LOT_SIZE",
    "minQty": "0.00100000",
    "maxQty": "100000.00000000",
    "stepSize": "0.00100000"
  }
```

### MAX_NUM_ORDERS
The `MAX_NUM_ORDERS` filter defines the maximum number of orders an account is allowed to have open on a symbol.
Note that both "algo" orders and normal orders are counted for this filter.

**/exchangeInfo format:**
```javascript
  {
    "filterType": "MAX_NUM_ORDERS",
    "limit": 25
  }
```

### MAX_NUM_ALGO_ORDERS
The `MAX_NUM_ALGO_ORDERS` filter defines the maximum number of "algo" orders an account is allowed to have open on a symbol.
"Algo" orders are `STOP_LOSS`, `STOP_LOSS_LIMIT`, `TAKE_PROFIT`, and `TAKE_PROFIT_LIMIT` orders.

**/exchangeInfo format:**
```javascript
  {
    "filterType": "MAX_NUM_ALGO_ORDERS",
    "maxNumAlgoOrders": 5
  }
```

### MAX_NUM_ICEBERG_ORDERS
The `MAX_NUM_ICEBERG_ORDERS` filter defines the maximum number of `ICEBERG` orders an account is allowed to have open on a symbol.
An `ICEBERG` order is any order where the `icebergQty` is > 0.

**/exchangeInfo format:**
```javascript
  {
    "filterType": "MAX_NUM_ICEBERG_ORDERS",
    "maxNumIcebergOrders": 5
  }
```

## Exchange Filters
### EXCHANGE_MAX_NUM_ORDERS
The `MAX_NUM_ORDERS` filter defines the maximum number of orders an account is allowed to have open on the exchange.
Note that both "algo" orders and normal orders are counted for this filter.

**/exchangeInfo format:**
```javascript
  {
    "filterType": "EXCHANGE_MAX_NUM_ORDERS",
    "maxNumOrders": 1000
  }
```

### EXCHANGE_MAX_NUM_ALGO_ORDERS
The `MAX_ALGO_ORDERS` filter defines the maximum number of "algo" orders an account is allowed to have open on the exchange.
"Algo" orders are `STOP_LOSS`, `STOP_LOSS_LIMIT`, `TAKE_PROFIT`, and `TAKE_PROFIT_LIMIT` orders.

**/exchangeInfo format:**
```javascript
  {
    "filterType": "EXCHANGE_MAX_ALGO_ORDERS",
    "maxNumAlgoOrders": 200
  }
```
